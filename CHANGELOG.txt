Camera Shake Changelog

************ Version 1.3.1f1 ***********
Fixed depreciated warnings for newer Unity versions.
Renamed CameraShakeEditor.cs to CameraShakeInspector.cs.

************ Version 1.3.0f1 ************
NOTE: This version includes some refactoring and API changes (including a namespace change) - Make sure to back up before upgrading as serialized values WILL be wiped!

Renamed ThinksquirrelSoftware namespace to Thinksquirrel. Users using Unity 3 should not import the Thinksquirrel.Utilities namespace in their projects.
Changed version numbering scheme to match other Thinksquirrel products.
Changed Camera.Shake methods to CameraShake.ShakeAll, Changed DoShake methods to Shake, depreciated instance property, and introduced a method to get all Camera Shake components in the scene.
Some code cleanup and less garbage allocation.
Added support to adjust local position when shaking instead of the camera matrix. This is recommended to resolve issues with shadows.
Added onPreShake and onPostShake events for each individual shake. These can be assigned and then used with the parameterless Shake() methods to cut down on boilerplate code.

************ Version 1.2.0 ************
Added a CancelShake overload that takes a time argument. This will immediately cancel all shakes and move the camera matrix back to its original position.
Small compatibility fix for future Unity versions.

************ Version 1.1.0 ************
Added shake rotation - works on both orthographic and perspective cameras.
Various performance fixes.

************ Version 1.0.2 ************
Critical matrix transformation bugfix. Please update!

************ Version 1.0.1 ************
Added support for multiple cameras.
NOTE: The GUI shake distance is based on the first camera in the camera list.

The camera matrix is adjusted directly instead of the local transform - moving cameras can now shake properly.

************ Version 1.0.0 ************
Initial version.
